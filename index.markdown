Welcome to my personal website! I'm a Senior Applied Machine Learning Scientist at Splunk where I have been working on problems involving Natural Language to Code translation, Named Entity Recognition, Quantile Sketches for data streams, and Machine Learning with Graphs. I have also acquired experience in conducting research, prototyping and implementing novel solutions, and collaborating with product teams.
